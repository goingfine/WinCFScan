* Here also you can load saved previous results and scan only on those IPs by clicking on `Scan in results` button.
* You can set number of concurrent scan process to speed up your scan but be careful about using large values. Set it base on your CPU threads and also your connection speed. High number of concurrent processes might lead to scan timeout and loose some of working IPs.
